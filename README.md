This is my submission for the Module 5 Lesson 3 assingment.

The following modules consist of :
- The main 'gym_database' module where functions are called and displayed to show manipulation of data.
- The 'sessions' module which holds functions for manipulating data in the 'WorkoutSessions' table of our database.
